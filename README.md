# Run the project
If you want to see the _demo_ before, start coding: 
[Demo - Revex](https://main--revex.netlify.app)

## Dependencies
This project requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version _16.14.2 - LTS_ or above. <br/>
And I recommend the use of [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com).

## Installation
To start, you have two options:
  1. Make a fork from this repository. _not recommended_
  2. Press the `Use this template` button and follow the GitHub instructions. _recommended_


Then, on the project `folder/directory`, run the command to install all the dependencies.
```bash
yarn install
```

_You can use `npm` if you prefer_

# Run Locally
Because of Vite, when all the dependencies are installed, it's super simple to start a local server.

### Development.
This should make a local server on the port 3000.
```bash
yarn dev
```
With the code running, go to: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Production.
This command will generate a production version of your code.
```bash
yarn build
```

And to check production locally. _(need to run build first)_
```bash
yarn preview
```

## How to deploy your code to show to the world what can you do.
This project has a [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) base settings. _You can see this on the [netlify.toml](https://github.com/Johann-Goncalves-Pereira/Revex/blob/main/netlify.toml) file_.

So if you want to follow this path of deploying it. It is super **easy** and **simple**. Just go to Netlify website, make an account or login in.
Add your `repository` with this template and follow the instructions of Netlify. <br/>
